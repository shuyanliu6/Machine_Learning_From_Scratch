    "## Logistic Regression Vectorized Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hypothesis Function in Vector Form\n",
    "The hypothesis function calculates the predicted probability for all training examples in a vectorized manner using the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h = \\sigma(X \\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( h \\): \\( m \\times 1 \\) vector of predicted probabilities.\n",
    "- \\( X \\): \\( m \\times n \\) matrix of training examples, where each row represents an input vector \\( x^{(i)} \\) and \\( m \\) is the number of examples.\n",
    "- \\( \\theta \\): \\( n \\times 1 \\) vector of parameters (weights and bias).\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \\): Sigmoid function that maps real-valued inputs into the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function ensures that the output is between 0 and 1, which is interpreted as the probability that the output is 1 for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cost Function in Vector Form\n",
    "The cost function measures the error between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels for all training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\left[ y^T \\log(h) + (1 - y)^T \\log(1 - h) \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( J(\\theta) \\): Cost function, which is a scalar value representing the average error across all examples.\n",
    "- \\( y \\): \\( m \\times 1 \\) vector of actual labels (0 or 1).\n",
    "- \\( h \\): \\( m \\times 1 \\) vector of predicted probabilities, calculated from the hypothesis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function computes the cross-entropy loss, which is used to evaluate how well the logistic regression model fits the data. It penalizes incorrect predictions more heavily, making it effective for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Gradient of the Cost Function in Vector Form\n",
    "The gradient of the cost function is used to determine the direction to update the parameters \\( \\theta \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} X^T (h - y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\nabla J(\\theta) \\): Gradient vector, which is \\( n \\times 1 \\) and represents the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter \\( \\theta_j \\).\n",
    "- \\( X^T \\): Transpose of the input matrix \\( X \\), resulting in a \\( n \\times m \\) matrix.\n",
    "- \\( h - y \\): \\( m \\times 1 \\) vector of errors between predicted probabilities and actual labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient helps in updating the model parameters during gradient descent to reduce the overall cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters Explanation\n",
    "- **\\( X \\)**: Input feature matrix with dimensions \\( m \\times n \\), where \\( m \\) is the number of training examples and \\( n \\) is the number of features.\n",
    "- **\\( \\theta \\)**: Parameter vector with dimensions \\( n \\times 1 \\), representing the weights and bias for the model.\n",
    "- **\\( y \\)**: True labels vector with dimensions \\( m \\times 1 \\), containing binary labels (0 or 1).\n",
    "- **\\( h \\)**: Predicted probability vector with dimensions \\( m \\times 1 \\), containing the probabilities calculated using the sigmoid function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Functions\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Function**: Calculates the predicted probabilities for all training examples using a linear combination of features and a sigmoid function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  h = \\sigma(X \\theta)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Function**: Measures the average error across all examples using cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\left[ y^T \\log(h) + (1 - y)^T \\log(1 - h) \\right]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient of the Cost Function**: Provides the direction and magnitude of change needed to minimize the cost function.\n",
